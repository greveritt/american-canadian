American to Canadian Translator
Copyright 2012 Gregory R. Everitt
=================

Promptly translates any string of American English to Canadian English.

Simply type the sentence you want to translate, press enter, and let the magic work!

This should work on any computer with .NET or Mono, but I have yet to test for compatibility.
